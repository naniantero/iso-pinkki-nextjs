## Getting Started

Project needs all kinds of like.. top secret API keys and whatnot, so you probably won't get this thing running locally. However, there's a demo running at [https://iso-pinkki-nextjs.vercel.app/](https://iso-pinkki-nextjs.vercel.app/). 


## TODO

Things are pretty much in progress. At least following things should be considered:

* Admin
* Make the Redis implementation more robust
